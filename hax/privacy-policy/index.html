        <p>The app does not collect any of your data.</p>
        <p>Any data that you enter yourself, such as the settings, is stored locally and never leaves your device.</p>
        <p>The app uses both the official <a href="https://github.com/HackerNews/API">Hacker News API</a> and the <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/api">HN Search API</a> services to retrieve data from the website. Being web services, they may collect data such as your IP address and basic information about your device.</p>
        <p>The project is open-source, so you can check out the code on <a href="https://github.com/lui5fl/hax">GitHub</a>.</p>
