        <p>The app uses both the official <a href="https://github.com/HackerNews/API">Hacker News API</a> and the <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/api">HN Search API</a> services to retrieve data from the website. Being web services, they may collect data such as your IP address and basic information about your device.</p>
