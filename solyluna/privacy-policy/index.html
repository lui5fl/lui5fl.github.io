        <h2>Solyluna Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>This privacy policy is applicable to the Solyluna app (hereinafter referred to as "Application") for mobile devices, which was developed by Luis Fariña Lázaro (hereinafter referred to as "Service Provider") as an Ad Supported service. This service is provided "AS IS".</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</h3>

        <p>The Application displays advertisements provided by Unity. All advertisements are non-targeted in order to conform to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For more information, please refer to Unity's <a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>. No personal information is stored.

        <br>
        <h3>Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?</h3>
        <p>The Application does not gather precise information about the location of your mobile device.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?</h3>
        <p>The Application does not transmit any personal information. The Service Provider will share your information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.</p>
        <p>Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Privacy Policy about handling data. Below are the links to the Privacy Policy of the third-party service providers used by the Application:</p>
        <ul>

        <a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unity</a>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Service Provider initializes the Unity Ads SDK with the parameter “gdpr.consent” set to "false", so that advertisements are non-targeted and no personal information is transmitted.</p>

        <h3>Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information</h3>
        <p>If you would like the Service Provider to delete User Provided Data that you have provided via the Application, please contact them at contact@luisfl.me and they will respond in a reasonable time.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. The Service Provider provides physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information they process and maintain. For example, they do not collect personal information from users, and no personal information is disclosed to any third party. Please be aware that, although they endeavor to provide reasonable security for information they process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.</p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <h3>Your Consent</h3>
